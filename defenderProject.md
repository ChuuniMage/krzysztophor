## Project Overview

This a blog detailing one of my first projects learning Typescript – a Discord bot, implementing the the Discord.js API. I’m going to showcase the code's development from my initial commit to github, up to the current commit. he code underwent a lot of revisions from early development, and 

The purpose of the discord bot is to provide custom quality-of-life commands for the Orthodox Christian discord server’s Administrators & Moderators.
